# Chess Game

## Overview

This project is a simple chess game implemented using the Qt library. It showcases the classic game of chess with a graphical user interface, allowing players to compete against each other. This project was a collaboration between two people. The objective was to learn and implement object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in a real-world project.

## 🌟 Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface built with the Qt framework.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to play against each other on the same device.
- **Standard Chess Rules**: Implements all standard chess rules including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
